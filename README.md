# Wheat Grain Counting

Makes use of Python 2.7 and the scikit machine learning and image processing libraries (which can be found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [here](http://scikit-image.org)).

Also includes a helper standalone program for ROI extraction however it is only available for Mac OS X and certain flavours of Linux at this time. Can be found in dist/gui/. Run from terminal with the command "./dist/gui/gui". Source is contained in "gui.py" and "gui\_checkbox\_handlers.py".

**Note: _TensorFlow is required to use the CNN functionality (CNN.py). If you do
not have TensorFlow already installed, visit [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md)
for detailed instructions on how to install it._**
